In this part, the nested low-level controller needed to achieve trajectory following is explained. The controller is separated into five parts:

 - body rate control
 - reduced attitude control
 - altitude control
 - heading control
 - lateral position control
 
 The block diagram of this contoller is here

 Each of the methods in 'controller.py' is here

* **1- Body Rate Control ( body_rate_control() )**
```py

```
* **2- Reduced Attitude Control ( roll_pitch_control() )**
```py

```    
* **3- Altitude Control ( altitude_control() )** 
```py


```  
* **4- Heading Control ( yaw_control() )**
```py    

```

* **5- Lateral Position Control ( lateral_position_control() )**
```py
